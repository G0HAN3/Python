# 📘 Python Code Lectures & Learnings

This is where I document everything I'm learning in Python — from the absolute basics to some advanced concepts. It's part study notes, part personal cheat sheet, and part code sandbox.

## 📚 What You'll Find Here

- 🚀 Code written during or after lectures
- 🧠 My personal notes and explanations
- 🧩 Problem-solving techniques


## 🎯 Why This Exists

This repo serves as:
- A **revision notebook** for me
- A **quick reference** for concepts I’ve already learned
- A **public log** of my progress
- A place to reinforce my understanding by writing code and documenting it

## 🛠️ How It's Structured

Each folder is organized by topic or lecture series. Inside each you'll find:
- Code files (`.py`, `.java`, etc.)
- Notes in markdown where applicable
- README files summariz
